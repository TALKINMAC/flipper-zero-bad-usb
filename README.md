üëâ BADUSB/BADKB FILE MODS
COLLECTIONS OF FLIPPER ZERO FILES ARE PLENTIFUL ON GITHUB. WE‚ÄôRE BLESSED TO HAVE THEM BUT WITH THIS ABUNDANCE COMES UNWANTED DISORGANIZATION. I WAS WORKING WITH BADUSB (BADKB) REPOS AND THIS EXACT ISSUE DROVE MY OCD BANANAS. THE INCONSISTENT FILE NAMES, FOLDERS, DUPLICATE FOLDERS, DUPLICATE FILE NAMES, FOLDERS WITH ZERO DOCS, FILE NAMING THAT MADE ZERO SENSE TO ME AND SO ON. 

FOR MOST PEOPLE THIS WOULDN'T BOTHER THEM AT ALL BUT IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE SOULS LIKE MYSELF, THIS REPO IS FOR YOU AND I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN! 

üëâ ABOUT
COMPILATION OF 99% OF THE BADUSB FILES ON GITHUB VISUALLY CLEANED UP AND FILE NAMES & FOLDERS FORMATTED.

üëâ THESE FILES ARE SOURCED FROM: 
I-Am-Jakoby
UNC0V3R3D
SHUR1K-N
UberGuidoZ
Hack5 
Aleff 
FalsePhilosopher 
djsime1

üëâ I DID NOT CREATE ANY OF THE PAYLOADS OR ASSOCIATING FILES AND I TRIED TO MAKE SURE THE ORIGINAL README FILES AND CREDITS WERE INCLUDED. 

üëâ SUMMARY
TO BEGIN ALL OF THE FOLDERS HAVE BEEN FORMATTED TO BE VISUALLY APPEALING AND CONSISTENT ON THE FLIPPER MENUS. THIS MEANS AT TIMES CHANGING THE CASE OF THE NAME, REMOVING CHARACTERS, OR SUMMARIZING LONG FILE NAMES. 

üëâTHE HIERCHY WAS THE FIRST TO BE SORTED. THE BASE FOLDER LOOKS JUST LIKE THE REPO ORIGINALLY EXCEPT WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE ‚ÄúRANSOM‚Äù FOLDER. 

üëâ AS YOU NAVIGATE YOU‚ÄôLL NOTICE ALL OS‚ÄôS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SAME LEVEL. THE SOURCE * HAD A FOLDER TITLED ‚ÄúUNIX LIKE‚Äù THAT HAS BEEN REMOVED. 

üëâ ALL MAIN FOLDERS AND ALL FILES HAVE BEEN EDITED TO INCLUDE AN OS PREFIX SUCH AS: WIN, LINUX, OSX, CHROMEBOOK, ETC ACCORDING TO THE INTENDED OS. 

WIN-RUBBER-DUCKY
OSX-RICKROLL

üëâ TO ENSURE THIS IS CORRECT I HAVE OPENED EVERY SINGLE README WITHIN EACH PAYLOAD AND CONFIRMED WHEN POSSIBLE. 

üëâ IF THE PAYLOAD DID NOT HAVE A FILE FOLDER THEN I CREATED ONE AND COPIED THE FILE INSIDE. 

üëâ SINCE I'M NOT THE BRIGHTEST I MANUALLY DID THIS BY HAND ONLY TO REALIZED THERE'SABSOLUTELY A SCRIPT TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THIS FOR ME WHAT AM I DOING? BUT BY THEN IT WAS TOO LATE SO I DOUBLED DOWN AND SCALED UP MY WORK LOAD TO INCLUDE SUB FOLERS, SUMMARIZING LONG FILE NAMES, ADDING DESCRIPTIONS, AND ZAPPING ANYTHING THAT WOULD TRIGGER A BIT OF OCD IN THE USER. 

üëâ ONE EXAMPLE IS "ADMIN THAT NEVER SLEEPS". THIS IS NOW "NEW ADMIN DISABLE SLEEP" AND THE README FILE HAS ALL THE INFO YOU‚ÄôD NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE PAYLOAD. 

üëâ SINCE MOST OF THE REPOS HAD MIRRORING FILES I TRIED TO INCLUDE THOSE FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE. FOR EXAMPLE IF HACK5 HAD A README THAT SAID THEY CREATED THE PAYLOAD THEN I INCLUDED HIS COPY OF THE FILES. IF ALL SOURCES HAD THE SAME EXACT FILES I CHOSE AT RANDOM WHICH TO COPY. 

üëâ LIST OF MODIFICATIONS
- ALL OF THE "_" HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO "-" ON MAIN FOLDER NAMES AND FILES
- ALL MAIN FOLDER NAMESAND FILES HAVE HAD THEIR CASE ADJUSTED 
- EDITED LONG OR IRRELEVANT FILE NAMES
- CREATED FOLDERS FOR PAYLOADS THAT DID NOT HAVE A FOLDER 
- ALL OF THE MOBILE PAYLOADS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED INTO THE FOLDER ‚ÄúMOBILE‚Äù
- PREFIXES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO ALL FILE AND FOLDER NAMES TO QUICKLY REFERENCE THE INTEDED OS
FILE NAMES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO BETTER MATCH THE DESIGNED PAYLOAD EFFECT
- ALL OF THE SOURCE README FILES ARE INCLUDED IN THE README AND PAYLOAD FOLDERS
-  I‚ÄôM SURE I‚ÄôM MISSING SOMETHING BUT YOU GET THE IDEA 

üëâ I WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE SUBGHZ AND EVIL PORTAL FILES NEXT. AFTER THAT I‚ÄôM NOT SURE IF ANY MORE WILL FOLLOW AS THESE ARE THE ONLY 3 FUNCTIONS I USE.
